                    Jahan in memory of his wife Mumtaz Mahal, had been initially
                    named 'Roza-e-Munavvara' which means Unique Building, but
                    was then renamed by Shah Jahan as Taj Mahal as a loving
                    tribute to his wife for whom his love surpassed all belief.
                    Shah Jahan was very upset about the death of his wife, hence
                    spent years creating the most beautiful site.
